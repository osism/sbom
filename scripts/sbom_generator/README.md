# Scripts

Scripts in this folder are inteded to scrub the whole osism org for packages to be mirrored (containers, deb-packages, pip-packages, ansible collections and roles)

They create list(s), that are not cleaned. They have been used only once with manual interaction, therefore they might be used on own risk and might need some development.
